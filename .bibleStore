Job 35:001
<v>[1] </v>Elihu spoke further [to Job] and said,
<v>[2] </v>Do you think this is your right, <i>or</i> are you saying, My righteousness is more than God’s,
<v>[3] </v>That you ask, What advantage have you? How am I profited more than if I had sinned?
<v>[4] </v>I will answer you and your companions with you.
<v>[5] </v>Look to the heavens and see; and behold the skies which are higher than you.
<v>[6] </v>If you have sinned, how does that affect God? And if your transgressions are multiplied, what have you done to Him?
<v>[7] </v>If you are righteous, what do you [by that] give God? Or what does He receive from your hand?
<v>[8] </v>Your wickedness touches and affects a man such as you are, and your righteousness is for yourself, one of the human race [but it cannot touch God, Who is above such influence].
<v>[9] </v>Because of the multitudes of oppressions the people cry out; they cry for help because of the violence of the mighty.
<v>[10] </v>But no one says, Where is God my Maker, Who gives songs of rejoicing in the night, <f>ⓐ</f>
<v>[11] </v>Who teaches us more than the beasts of the earth and makes us wiser than the birds of the heavens?
<v>[12] </v>[The people] cry out because of the pride of evil men, but He does not answer.
<v>[13] </v>Surely God will refuse to answer [the cry which is] vanity (vain and empty — instead of abiding trust); neither will the Almighty regard it —
<v>[14] </v>How much less when [missing His righteous judgment on earth] you say that you do not see Him, that your cause is before Him, and you are waiting for Him!
<v>[15] </v>But now because God has not [speedily] punished in His anger and seems to be unaware of the wrong <i>and</i> oppression [of which a person is guilty],
<v>[16] </v>Job uselessly opens his mouth and multiplies words without knowledge [drawing the worthless conclusion that the righteous have no more advantage than the wicked].
