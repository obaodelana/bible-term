Joshua 13:001
<v>[1] </v>Now Joshua was old and gone far in years [over 100], and the Lord said to him, You have grown old and are gone far in years, and very much of the land still remains to be possessed.
<v>[2] </v>This is the land that remains: all the regions of the Philistines and all those of the Geshurites:
<v>[3] </v>From the Shihor [River] which is east of Egypt, northward to the boundary of Ekron, all of it counted as Canaanite; there are five rulers of the Philistines, those of Gaza, Ashdod, Ashkelon, Gath, and Ekron, and those of the Avvites;
<v>[4] </v>In the south, all the land of the Canaanites, and Mearah, which belongs to the Sidonians, to Aphek, to the boundary of the Amorites,
<v>[5] </v>And the land of the Gebalites; and all Lebanon toward the east, from Baal-gad below Mount Hermon to the gate of Hamath.
<v>[6] </v>As for all the inhabitants of the hill country from Lebanon to Misrephoth-maim, even all the Sidonians, I will Myself drive them out from before the Israelites; only allot the land to Israel for an inheritance, as I have commanded you.
<v>[7] </v>So now divide this land for an inheritance to the nine tribes and the half-tribe of Manasseh.
<v>[8] </v>With the other half-tribe of Manasseh, the Reubenites and the Gadites received their inheritance beyond the Jordan eastward, as Moses the servant of the Lord gave them:
<v>[9] </v>From Aroer on the edge of the Valley of the [river] Arnon, and the city in the midst of the valley, and all the tableland of Medeba as far as Dibon;
<v>[10] </v>And all the cities of Sihon king of the Amorites, who ruled in Heshbon, as far as the boundary of the Ammonites;
<v>[11] </v>And Gilead, and the region of the Geshurites and Maacathites, and all Mount Hermon, and all Bashan to Salecah —
<v>[12] </v>All the kingdom of Og in Bashan, who reigned in Ashtaroth and Edrei and alone was left of the Rephaim [giants]; for these Moses had defeated and driven out.
<v>[13] </v>Yet the Israelites did not drive out the Geshurites or the Maacathites, but Geshur and Maacath dwell among [them] still.
<v>[14] </v>Only to the tribe of Levi Moses gave no inheritance; the sacrifices made by fire to the Lord, the God of Israel, are their inheritance, as He said to him.
<v>[15] </v>And Moses gave an inheritance to the tribe of the Reubenites according to their families:
<v>[16] </v>Their territory was from Aroer on the edge of the Valley of the [river] Arnon, and the city in the midst of the valley, and all the tableland by Medeba;
<v>[17] </v>With Heshbon and all its cities which are on the plain; Dibon, Bamoth-baal, and Beth-baal-meon,
<v>[18] </v>Jahaz, Kedemoth, Mephaath,
<v>[19] </v>Kiriathaim, Sibmah, and Zereth-shahar on the hill of the valley,
<v>[20] </v>Beth-peor, Pisgah’s slopes, and Beth-jeshimoth,
<v>[21] </v>All the cities of the plain and all the kingdom of Sihon king of the Amorites, who ruled in Heshbon, whom Moses defeated along with the leaders of Midian, Evi, Rekem, Zur, Hur, and Reba, the princes of Sihon who lived in the land.
<v>[22] </v>Balaam son of Beor, the soothsayer, the Israelites also killed with the sword among the rest of their slain. <f>ⓐ</f>
<v>[23] </v>And the border of the Reubenites was the Jordan. This was the inheritance of the Reubenites according to their families, with their cities and villages.
<v>[24] </v>Moses gave an inheritance also to the tribe of the Gadites according to their families.
<v>[25] </v>Their territory was Jazer, and all the cities of Gilead, and half the land of the Ammonites as far as Aroer east of Rabbah;
<v>[26] </v>And from Heshbon to Ramath-mizpeh and Betonim, and from Mahanaim to the territory of Debir;
<v>[27] </v>And in the valley, Beth-haram, Beth-nimrah, Succoth, and Zaphon, the rest of the realm of Sihon king of Heshbon, with the Jordan as a boundary, to the lower end of the Sea of Chinnereth east of the Jordan.
<v>[28] </v>This is the inheritance of the Gadites according to their families, with their cities and villages.
<v>[29] </v>And Moses gave an inheritance to the half-tribe of Manasseh; it was allotted to them according to their families.
<v>[30] </v>Their region extended from Mahanaim through all Bashan, the entire kingdom of Og king of Bashan, and all the towns of Jair, which are in Bashan, sixty cities,
<v>[31] </v>And half of Gilead, and Ashtaroth and Edrei, cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan; these were allotted to the people of Machir son of Manasseh for half of the Machirites according to their families.
<v>[32] </v>These are the inheritances which Moses distributed in the plains of Moab beyond the Jordan east of Jericho.
<v>[33] </v>But to the tribe of Levi, Moses gave no inheritance; the Lord, the God of Israel, is their inheritance, as He told them.
